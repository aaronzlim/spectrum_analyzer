Project: An audio spectrum analyzer display using Neopixel LED's

Microcontroller: Arduino Micro, ATmega32U4

Status: IN DEVELOPMENT

Completed:
    - Power supply works
    - Neopixel strips have been soldered together
    - Neopixels have been tested and are functional
    - LED control code works
    - Color scheme look up tables are now switchable

To Do:
    - Solder together a small stereo to mono adapter
    - Test voltage levels from audio input (aux and mic)
    - Test Arduino A/D converter with different clk speeds
    - Test MSGEQ7
    - Decide on how to implement gain control
    - Implement pushbuttons to switch color schemes
