Project: An audio spectrum analyzer display using Neopixel LED's

Microcontroller: Arduino Micro

Status: IN DEVELOPMENT

Completed:
    - Power supply works
    - Neopixel strips have been soldered together
    - Neopixels have been tested and are functional

To Do:
    - Get Arduino code functional (setMatrix function needs work)
    - Solder together a small stereo to mono adapter
    - Test voltage levels from audio input (aux and mic)
    - Test Arduino A/D converter (timing?)
    - Test filter bank
    - Decide on how to implement gain control
    - Decide on look up table for LED color selection
